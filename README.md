# Predicting Bitcoin Price with Supervised Learning Methods

## Bitcoin Price Prediction

This repository explores various machine learning models for predicting Bitcoin prices. The current focus is on supervised learning techniques. Future additions include advanced machine learning approaches.

### Project Overview

Bitcoin's price volatility makes prediction a challenging but interesting task. This project investigates the effectiveness of different machine learning models in forecasting future prices. The initial implementation utilizes supervised learning methods.

### Current Implementation

* **Supervised learning** models (e.g., Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines) are used to predict Bitcoin prices.
* The project utilizes historical price data to train and test the models.
* The code is written in Python (specify libraries used like pandas, scikit-learn) in Jupyter Notebook.

### Future Work

* Exploration of **deep learning** architectures (e.g., LSTMs) for time series forecasting.
* Performance comparison of different models.
* Integration of additional features that might influence price (e.g., social sentiment).

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zac4j/btc-price-prediction.git
```

2. Run the prediction Jupter Notebook:

- Supervised Learning approach: [btc_price_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/zac4j/btc-price-prediction/blob/main/supervised%20learning/btc_price_prediction.ipynb)
- Deep Learning approach: TBD

**Note:** This script assumes the data is pre-processed and stored in a specific format. You might need to modify the script based on your data structure.

### Disclaimer

Bitcoin price prediction is a complex task, and the models implemented here are for educational purposes only. The predictions should not be considered financial advice.
