# Predicting Bitcoin Price with Supervised Learning Methods

In the world of cryptocurrency market, traditional technical analysis (TA) is a method for studying historical price charts and trading volume data to identify potential future price movements. However, due to the inherent volatility and non-linear relationships within the market, traditional methods often fall short.

This project aims to develop and evaluate Supervised Learning models for predicting bitcoin price. The focus will be on assessing the effectiveness of Linear Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) in capturing historical price patterns and making predictions for future price movements.

This finding underscores the importance of considering the inherent non-linearity of cryptocurrency price movements. Future efforts in this domain could benefit from exploring alternative models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are specifically designed for time series data and can potentially learn and model these non-linear relationships more effectively.

Furthermore, we can incorporate additional features beyond the OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) and Volume data, such as news sentiment analysis, or technical indicators, might further improve the accuracy of predictions.
